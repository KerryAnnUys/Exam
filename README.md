**NB: Do not add or remove any files to this repository in the process of answering the test questions. Only answers in the correct supplied files will be marked.**

Before starting with the assessment, pull any changes to this repo from GitHub and then add your student number and the computer number where you are working to lines two and three of this file. Save, add, commit, and push these changes back to GitHub.

**Remember to save, add, commit, and push your changes _at least_ after every question. In addition to being part of the submission, there are marks awarded for doing so. NB: You will not be permitted to leave the test venue until an invigilator has certified that you have committed your work. If the invigilator assists you in committing your work, you will receive zero for the appropriate question.**

This assessment consists of 50 marks in one hour. Students should aim to spend approximately one minute per mark, allowing some time to finalise answers at the end of the test.

In this repository you will find one SQL file - `solution.sql` - in which you will answer all questions. You will also find a file, `data.txt` that contains suitable data for your database. You will need this data to insert into your database.

As you are working on this assessment, you are permitted to check the result of your development using a SQLite database and the SQLTools VS Code extension loaded into your codespace. You are expected to know how to use these tools.

This is a closed book assessment and no access to external tools or resources is permitted.
